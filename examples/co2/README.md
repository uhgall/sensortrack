# SensorTrack Example: CO2 Sensor Comparison

## Overview
This directory contains a complete example of using SensorTrack to compare readings from multiple CO2 sensors:

- `prompt.txt`: prompt template for processing sensor images and extracting data in format defined `model.py`
- `model.py`: Pydantic model defining sensor data structure
- `process_images.py`: Script for processing images and saving the data to a bunch of json files
- `analyze_data.py`: Example of using TimeSeriesPlotter for data visualization

## Experimental Setup

As generated by the LLM, which is admittedly not great but funny and more or less correct.

### Equipment
- Test chamber: More or less sealed plastic container
- CO2 source: SodaStream
- Measurement tool: Syringe with a short hose

### Test Protocol
The experiment demonstrates SensorTrack's capabilities through a controlled CO2 injection test:

1. Initial setup with all sensors in sealed container
2. Sequential CO2 additions with precise timing
3. One repositioning event for measurement stability
4. Final larger volume injection

## Detailed Timeline

| Time (t) | Action | Volume Added |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| 18 | CO2 injection | 50ml |
| 39 | CO2 injection | 50ml |
| 141 | CO2 injection | 50ml |
| 150 | Box repositioning | - |
| 153 | CO2 injection | 50ml |
| 175 | CO2 injection | 50ml |
| 182 | CO2 injection | 50ml |
| 190 | CO2 injection | 100ml |

## Summary of CO2 Additions
- 6 injections × 50ml = 300ml
- 1 injection × 100ml = 100ml
- **Total CO2 volume**: 450ml

## Key Features Demonstrated
- Multi-sensor data extraction from images
- Automated data validation and correction
- Time series analysis and visualization
- Handling of measurement anomalies
- Comparative sensor analysis

## Notes
- Timestamps in the dataset correspond to image numbers
- Box repositioning at t=150 shows handling of experimental adjustments
- Results directory contains JSON files with processed readings
- The example includes data validation to handle missing digits and anomalies
