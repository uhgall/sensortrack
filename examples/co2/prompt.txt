We are comparing the readings from several CO2 sensors to test them for accuracy.
Analyze this image and extract the CO2 PPM reading from each of the sensors.
Look carefully at each sensor and read only the CO2 PPM reading.

Sometimes, when the last digit is a "1", it's easy to overlook it because there is a larger gap. 
So keep that in mind and return the correct value, don't ignore that last digit.

For the Asani sensor, be extra careful to read the correct value - the one below "CO2", to the left of where it says "ppm".

For Aranet sensor, the value is always the largest number.

{% if previous_reading %}
Here's the previous reading:
{{ previous_reading | tojson(indent=2) }}

Normally, the value for each sensor should not be too far from the previous reading for that sensor. 
So if you see a big jump, it's probably wrong.
{% endif %}
